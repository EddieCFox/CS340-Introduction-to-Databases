# CS340-Introduction-to-Databases
The occasional assignment and final project.

Not every assignment has been included because lots of them involved manipulating a database with SQL queries and then taking screenshots of the results at various phases. I no longer have access to the database and most of the screenshots, or the SQL queries I used, so I don't want to present an incomplete picture. Having screenshots of a database without being able to show how I got there doesn't help anyone.
